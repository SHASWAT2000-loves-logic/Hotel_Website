# Hotel_Website
**First Edit** (02/23/2022)- This Hotel Website was my first attempt to make a simple website only from basic HTML and CSS incorporating everything I learned in the last month. By basic, I mean, I have not used any of the modern CSS technologies like 
Flex and Grid, instead I used floats to align elements. This website is like a website of any other hotel which has a home page, about page and a contact page. 

The Hotel Website has 3 HTML files- 

a. index.html- home page

b. about.html- about page

c. contact.html- contact page

There is also a CSS folder, which has style.css file, which contains all the styling.
